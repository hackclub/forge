Building a model in the Forge editor is easy to learn, hard to master. You need abosultely no CAD or programming knowledge to get started. Since the Forge Editor is based on the [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org) modeling language, it presents a challenge to even the most experienced parametric modelers.
