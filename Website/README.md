# Forge editor

This is the forge editor site. Forge is a work in progress 3D printer YSWS(You Ship We Ship) project being worked on by teens at [hackclub](https://hackclub.com). You can find the official forge repository [here](https://github.com/EmperorNumerius/Forge), and if you wish to contribute, you should join the hackclub slack and visit the channel #forge-dev.

## Goal

The current plan is to have Microsoft's Monaco Editor with a OpenSCAD program in it, and a viewport that renders the current model. This is what has been implemented in the website already.

It is intended to look kind of like [this](https://ochafik.com/openscad2/).

## Run instructions

To run it, in your terminal:
Open the Website folder ```cd Website```
Reinstall all the packages ```npm i```
Run ```npm run dev```

#### Note from Malav:
The project will look something like this: (For those updating thier own repos, certain older deployments via vercel will be broken as they aren't configured correctly with the new changes)
