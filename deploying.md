# Deploying on Coolify

This guide covers deploying the app to [Coolify](https://coolify.io) as 4 resources: **main** (web), **worker** (Solid Queue), **PostgreSQL**, and **Redis**.

## Prerequisites

- A Coolify instance (self-hosted or cloud)
- Your repository connected to Coolify via GitHub

## 1. Create Services

### PostgreSQL

1. Go to your Coolify project and click **New Resource** > **Database** > **PostgreSQL**
2. Note the internal connection URL (e.g. `postgresql://postgres:password@project-db:5432/app`)

### Redis

1. Click **New Resource** > **Database** > **Redis**
2. Note the internal connection URL (e.g. `redis://default:password@project-redis:6379`)

## 2. Create the Main (Web) Application

1. Click **New Resource** > **Application**
2. Select your GitHub repository and branch
3. Set **Build Pack** to **Dockerfile**
4. Set **Dockerfile Location** to `Dockerfile`
5. Set the **Exposed Port** to `80`
6. Configure the health check to hit `/up` on port `80`

This builds with `Dockerfile` and runs Thruster + Rails server.

## 3. Create the Worker Application

1. Click **New Resource** > **Application**
2. Select the **same** GitHub repository and branch
3. Set **Build Pack** to **Dockerfile**
4. Set **Dockerfile Location** to `Dockerfile.worker`
5. **Do not** expose a port — the worker doesn't serve HTTP
6. **Disable** the health check (the worker is a background process, not a web server)

The worker builds with `Dockerfile.worker` and runs Solid Queue (`bin/jobs`) to process background jobs.

## 4. Setup Credentials

If you haven't already, delete the template's placeholder credentials and generate fresh ones:

```sh
rm config/credentials.yml.enc
bin/rails credentials:edit
```

Generate Active Record encryption keys and paste them into the credentials file:

```sh
bin/rails db:encryption:init
```

Copy the output into your credentials file so it looks like:

```yaml
active_record_encryption:
  primary_key: <generated>
  deterministic_key: <generated>
  key_derivation_salt: <generated>
```

The encrypted credentials file (`config/credentials.yml.enc`) is committed to the repo; the master key (`config/master.key`) is **not** — you'll set it as an environment variable in the next step.

## 5. Configure Environment Variables

Add the following environment variables to **both** the main and worker applications. Refer to `.env.production.example` for the full list.

**Do not** set `SOLID_QUEUE_IN_PUMA` — the worker container handles job processing separately.

### Required

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection URL from step 1 |
| `REDIS_URL` | Redis connection URL from step 1 |
| `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` | Contents of `config/master.key` |
| `SECRET_KEY_BASE` | Run `bin/rails secret` locally to generate |
| `APP_HOST` | Your app's domain (e.g. `app.example.com`) |

### OAuth & Integrations

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `HCA_CLIENT_ID` | HCA OAuth client ID |
| `HCA_CLIENT_SECRET` | HCA OAuth client secret |
| `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` | Slack bot token for profile sync |

### Storage (Cloudflare R2)

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | Cloudflare R2 access key |
| `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Cloudflare R2 secret key |
| `R2_BUCKET` | R2 bucket name |
| `R2_ENDPOINT` | R2 endpoint URL |

### Optional

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `GEOCODER_API_KEY` | Geocoding API key |
| `SKYLIGHT_AUTHENTICATION` | Skylight performance monitoring |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | Sentry error monitoring DSN |
| `LOOPS_API_KEY` | Loops.so API key for mailer |
| `MAILER_FROM` | Default from email address |
| `EXTERNAL_API_KEY` | API key for `/api/v1` endpoints |
| `UPTIME_WORKER_PING_URL` | Uptime monitoring ping URL |

## 6. Network Configuration

If your PostgreSQL and Redis resources are in the same Coolify project, use internal hostnames in `DATABASE_URL` and `REDIS_URL` so traffic stays on the internal Docker network.

## 7. Domain & SSL

1. In the **main** application's settings, add your custom domain
2. Coolify handles SSL certificates automatically via Let's Encrypt
3. The worker does not need a domain

## 8. Deploy

Deploy the **main** app first (its entrypoint runs `rails db:prepare` to apply migrations), then deploy the **worker**.

Push to your configured branch or click **Deploy** in the Coolify dashboard.

## Troubleshooting

- **Assets not loading**: Ensure `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` is set correctly — asset precompilation happens at build time with a dummy key, but the app needs the real key at runtime for encrypted credentials.
- **Database connection errors**: Verify `DATABASE_URL` uses the correct internal hostname and that the database resource is running.
- **WebSocket / Action Cable issues**: Confirm `REDIS_URL` is set and the Redis resource is healthy.
- **Jobs not processing**: Check the worker container's logs. Ensure it has the same `DATABASE_URL` and `REDIS_URL` as the main app.
